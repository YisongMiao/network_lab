#Introduction
It is all the project code for Computer Network Lab by University of Chinese Academy of Science in Academic Year 2017-2018 Semester 1, the course is taught by Prof Qinghua Wu on every Thursday morning.

#Experiments
We first did some general experiment including internet measuring, socket transfering data.
We then move on to IP level, we designed a router with ARP-Cache, ARP-protocol, ICMP-protocol, Longest-Matching for IP look-up. Also a OSPF-protocal.
We finally move on to TCP level, the change of TCP states was supported by a Finite State Machine.
