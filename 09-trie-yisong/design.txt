"We should break a abstract problem down to clear and simple sub-problem."

Unibit-Trie:
High-level description:
	We read every line from forwarding-table.txt.
	
	-Then we constrcut the unibit trie:
		-Show the total line and the percentage of work.
		-Translate the decimal into binary, and specially check the mask length.
		-If entry already exist, do nothing.
		-If entry not exist, insert
			-So how to insert?

	-When the translation is done, we do the search part.
